Upon installation of Linux Mint on Optiplex 3046 there were a few issues,

1. Graphics driver not working
    The system was packed with a GT 730, Mint chose the default open source driver but it was giving issues. Switching to Nvidia proprietary did not work.
    The solution was to uninstall "xserver-xorg-video-fbdev"

2. Audio port not working
    When you connect a headset, it recognizes the thing as headphones. Meaning, left/right doesn't work properly. Also the microphone.
    The issue was due to the fact, that linux can't recognize this is a multi/combo port.
    The fix was,
